# AI Image Detector

**Live Demo:** [Link to your GitHub Pages website here]

## Project Description

This project is a web-based application that detects whether an image was generated by an AI or is a real photograph. Users can upload an image, and the application's AI model will provide a prediction and a confidence score.

The front end is a simple static website hosted on GitHub Pages, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back end is an API hosted on AWS, which uses a containerized Docker image to run the AI detection model.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
* **HTML:** For the structure of the web page.
* **CSS:** For styling and layout.
* **JavaScript:** To handle user interactions, image previews, and communication with the backend API.



* **AWS API Gateway:** Manages API endpoints and handles CORS to enable secure cross-origin requests.  
* **AWS ECR:** Stores the Docker image containing the AI model.  
* **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** Deploys and runs the containerized AI model for processing image predictions.  


## How to Use

1.  **Visit the Live Demo:** Open the project's [Live Demo Link].
2.  **Upload an Image:** Click the "Choose File" button to select an image from your computer.
3.  **Get a Prediction:** Click the "Predict" button. The application will send the image to the backend API, and the result will be displayed on the page. The result includes a prediction (AI or Real) and a confidence score.
